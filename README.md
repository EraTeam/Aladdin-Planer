# AladdinPlaner

Python and JavaScript based application for project management.

### Basic setup fro flask
Note: Do everything in Terminal.


1. Install pip3: "sudo apt-get install python3-pip"
2. "pip3 install flask"

At this stage you have python package manager "pip3" and the FLASK framework installed.


### Running the project
Navigate to the project root dir, open Terminal and type in:

1. "export FLASK_APP=__init__.py"
2. "flask run"


To close the flask server, go back to the terminal and press: [STRG] + [c]

### Git-Notes: Files to ignore
Basically all files under "Aladdin-Planer/.idea" must be ignored.

Do this by  "Settings" -> "Version Control" -> "Configure Ignored Files" -> "Add" -> "Ignore all files under"
            -> "PATH_TO_YOUR_DIRECTORY/Aladdin-Planer/.idea"
